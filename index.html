    <p> The cause that I have chosen is a combination  of sports and diversity.
      As professional athletes have recently participated in numerous social
      causes, it reminds crazed fans and casual spectators of all professional/collegiate
      sports, that these athletes are very similar to us in their backgrounds and
      have originated from common upbringings. In my search for data sets, I was
      able to come across reports done by The Institute for Diversity and Ethics
      in Sport (TIDES) about the various sports leagues and media organizations
      across the U.S. Their 'Racial and Gender Report Cards' assess the diversity
      in these leagues from the players all the way up to ownership. The grades
      that they give out are based upon the percentages of different ethnicities
      and genders in the league compared to that of the demographics shown by
      the U.S. Census. From this data, I hope to help visualize the discrepency in
      the percentages of players of color compared to that of coaches and owners
      of color. An issue that can go unseen by the casual fan's eye. The link to
      the three data sets that I have chosen are posted below.
